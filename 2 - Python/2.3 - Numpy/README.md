### Numpy:
- Do 50 exercises from the notebook. If you are familiar with numpy, jump forward to more difficult questions.
- If you have no experience with numpy, do the first 50 exercises. Feel free to do more if you need additional training.
- Focus on understanding what's possible with numpy and less on remembering function names\syntax.
