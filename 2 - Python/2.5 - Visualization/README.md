### Data visualization
- Your goal in this exercise is to communicate and present findings in a visual and comprehensible way.
- The data you will work on is the titanic passengers data, you can find it titanic.xls file.
- The table columns are as follows:
    - passengerID
    - Survived - did the passenger survived
    - Pclass - passenger class
    - Name
    - Sex
    - Age
    - Sibsp - number of siblings and/or spouse on board
    - Parch - number of parents/children on board
    - Fare - ticket fare
    - Cabin - room number
    - Embarked - the port the passenger embarked from
- Plot graphs that depict:
    - How is age distributed in every pclass and in every age?
    -  Which family had lost the most members?
    - Is there a connection between the age of a passenger and it's chance of survival? What about his pclass?
    - What is the relation between survivors to deceased in every pclass?
- IMPORTANT: Present more findings with meaningful insights, as you see fit.
- For plotting graphs, read about matplotlib and plotly and work with these modules.
