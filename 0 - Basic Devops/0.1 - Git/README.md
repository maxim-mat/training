### Git

This part will teach you all the git basics you will need to know.
Once you're finished reading about git, clone this repository and create your own branch named [your name]-[your last name].

For every part or subpart (i.e. folder) of the training after this one, create a merge request (from your branch to main) once you're finished with it so that your mentor will track your progress and give you feedback.
