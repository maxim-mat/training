# Basic Devops

To be a functioning programmer in general, you will need to be familiar with a little bit of devops basics:
1. Git is the standard tool for code version control, it's necessary for development.
2. Docker is the standard tool for code deployment, it's required for running your finished code in production environments.

### Git

You will need to know git to start training because it's how the training is managed.
Once you're finished reading about git, clone this repository and create your own branch named [your_name]-training.

### Docker

You will need to know docker for when you deploy code to production or testing environments.
